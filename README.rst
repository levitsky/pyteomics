What is Pyteomics?
------------------

Pyteomics is a collection of lightweight and handy tools for Python that help
to handle various sorts of proteomics data. Pyteomics provides a growing set of
modules to facilitate the most common tasks in proteomics data analysis, such as:

* calculation of basic physico-chemical properties of polypeptides:

  * mass and isotopic distribution
  * charge and pI
  * chromatographic retention time

* access to common proteomics data:

  * MS or LC-MS data
  * FASTA databases
  * search engines output

* easy manipulation of sequences of modified peptides and proteins

The goal of the Pyteomics project is to provide a versatile, reliable and
well-documented set of open tools for the wide proteomics community.
One of the project's key features is Python itself, an open source language
increasingly popular in scientific programming. The main
applications of the library are reproducible statistical data analysis and rapid
software prototyping.
