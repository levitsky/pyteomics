Relation to other proteomics data analysis tools
------------------------------------------------

Our goal is to create an infrastructure for proteomics data analysis within
Python ecosystem. Pyteomics is **not** a proteomic search engine, **nor** does
it any data conversion. There are `other tools <http://www.ms-utils.org/>`_ for
that. Pyteomics does not aim to substitute any of these, but rather to coexist
and complement them.
