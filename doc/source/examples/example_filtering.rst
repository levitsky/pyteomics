Example 3: Search engines and PSM filtering
===========================================

In this example we are going to parse the output of several search engines and see what we can do with it
using **Pyteomics**.

Full Python code can be downloaded :download:`here <filtering/filtering.py>` (Python script)
and :download:`here <filtering/filtering.ipynb>` (IPython Notebook).
The files used in this example can be downloaded from
`here <http://pubdata.theorchromo.ru/pyteomics_filtering_example/>`_.
The example, including code, figures, and accompanying text, is contained in the IPython Notebook file.
