Introduction
============

This tutorial covers the basic Pyteomics functionality. For more details, 
please, check the API reference. You can also access the API docstrings from 
Python shell:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pyteomics.mass import calculate_mass
    >>> help(calculate_mass)

IPython users can use the following shortcut:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pyteomics.mass import calculate_mass
    >>> calculate_mass?

We expect the reader to be familiar with the basic Python syntax as well as 
proteomics concepts.
