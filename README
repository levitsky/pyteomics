What is Pyteomics?
------------------

Pyteomics is a collection of lightweight and handy tools for Python that help
to handle various sorts of proteomics data. Pyteomics provides a growing set of 
modules to facilitate the most common tasks in proteomics data analysis, such as:

* calculation of basic physico-chemical properties of polypeptides:

  * mass and isotopic distribution
  * charge and pI
  * chromatographic retention time

* access to common proteomics data:

  * MS or LC-MS data
  * FASTA databases
  * search engines output

* easy manipulation of sequences of modified peptides and proteins

The goal of the Pyteomics project is to provide a versatile, reliable and
well-documented set of open tools for the wide proteomics community. 
One of the project's key features is Python itself, a open source language 
increasingly popular in scientific programming. The main
applications of the library are reproducible statistical data analysis and rapid
software prototyping.
