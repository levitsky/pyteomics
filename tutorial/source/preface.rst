What is pyteomics?
------------------
Pyteomics is a collection of lightweight and handy tools for Python that help
to handle various sorts of proteomics data.
Pyteomics provides a growing set of modules to facilitate the most common tasks
in proteomics data analysis, such as:

* access to common proteomics data:

  * MS or LC-MS data
  * FASTA databases
  * search engines output

* calculation of basic physico-chemical properites of polypeptides:

  * mass and isotopic distribution
  * charge and pI
  * chromatographic retention time

* easy manipulation of sequences of modified peptides and proteins

One of the main features of Pyteomics is Python itself. Python is the perfect
choice for scientific research for multiple reasons:

* Python is truly free and open.
* Python is cross-platform: Win, Mac, Linux.
* It has a powerful syntax, easy to learn and use.
* Python is known for its unbeatable speed of development.
* "Batteries are included". Python comes with a rich set of standard and 
  extended libraries.
* Python has plenty of good 3rd-party statistical, numerical and graphing tools.
* Thanks to the powerful frameworks, on-line and desktop GUI applications are not 
  a problem for Python users.

The goal of the Pyteomics project is to provide a versatile, reliable and
well-documented set of open tools for the wide proteomics community. The main
application of the library is reproducible statistical data analysis and rapid
software prototyping.

Relation to the other proteomics data analysis tools
----------------------------------------------------
Our goal is to create an infrastructure for proteomics data analysis within
Python ecosystem. Pyteomics is **not** a proteomic search engine, **nor** does
it any data conversion. There are `other tools <http://www.ms-utils.org/>`_ for
that. Pyteomics does not aim to substitute any of these, but rather to coexist
and complement them.
