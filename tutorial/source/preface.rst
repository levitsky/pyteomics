What is pyteomics?
------------------
Pyteomics is a collection of lightweight and handy tools for Python that help
a researcher working in the field of proteomics to handle various sorts of data.
Pyteomics provides a growing set of modules to facilitate the most common tasks
in proteomics data analysis, such as:

* access to common proteomics data:

  * MS or LC-MS data
  * FASTA databases
  * search engines output

* calculation of basic physico-chemical properites of polypeptides:

  * mass
  * isotopic distributions
  * charge and pI
  * chromatographic retention time

* easy manipulation of sequences of modified peptides and proteins

One of the main features of Pyteomics is Python itself. Python is the perfect
choice for scientific research for multiple reasons:

* free and open
* cross-platform: Win, Mac, Linux
* powerful syntax, easy to learn and use
* unbeatable speed of development
* rich standard and extended libraries
* a rich set of statistical, numerical and graphing tools
* easy development of both on-line and desktop GUI applications 

The goal of the Pyteomics project is to provide a versatile, reliable and
well-documented set of open tools for the wide proteomics community. The main
application of the library is reproducible statistical data analysis and rapid
software prototyping.

Relation to the other proteomics data analysis tools
----------------------------------------------------
Our goal is to create an infrastructure for proteomics data analysis within
Python ecosystem. Pyteomics is **not** a proteomic search engine, **nor** does
it any data conversion. There are `other tools <http://www.ms-utils.org/>`_ for
that. Pyteomics does not aim to substitute any of these, but rather to coexist
and complement them.
