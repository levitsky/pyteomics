Introduction
============

In this tutorial we would like to cover the basic Pyteomics functionality.
For more details, please, check the API reference.

Also, if you are using pyteomics from an interactive Python environment such
as IPython, the reference entries are available from it. For example, in
IPython typing an objectâ€™s name followed or prepended by a question sign prints
its docstring, so typing:

::

    >>> from pyteomics.mass import calculate_mass
    >>> ?calculate_mass

will print the docstring of the :py:func:`calculate_mass` function.

.. note:: You only need to import functions once per session.

We expect the reader to be familiar with basic Python syntax as well as proteomics concepts.
